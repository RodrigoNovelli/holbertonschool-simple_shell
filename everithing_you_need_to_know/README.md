README.md
This repository contains the source code for a simple shell program, along with some additional scripts.

Shell Program
The shell program is implemented in C and provides basic functionalities such as reading user input, tokenizing the input into arguments, and executing commands.

Features
Reads user input from standard input
Tokenizes the input into arguments
Executes commands with the specified arguments

gcc -g -o shell shell.c

To run the shell program, run:
./shell
To exit the shell program, type exit and press enter.

Implementation Details
The shell program consists of the following files:

shell.c: The main implementation file that contains the main function and other helper functions.
shell.h: The header file that contains function prototypes and macro definitions.
Additional Scripts
The repository also includes some additional scripts that demonstrate the usage of the shell program.

Script 1: Simple Shell
This script is a simple implementation of a shell program that reads user input and executes commands.

Usage
To run the script, run:
